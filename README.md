# ðŸ”„ Sorting in C++

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim  
To study and implement **Sorting algorithms in C++**, including **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bucket Sort**, and to compare their efficiency, time complexity, and use cases.

## ðŸ“š Theory  

Sorting is the process of arranging data in a particular order (ascending or descending). Efficient sorting is crucial for optimizing search algorithms and data processing.

### ðŸ”‘ Characteristics of Sorting Algorithms  
- **Stability**: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.  
- **In-place vs. Out-of-place**: Whether extra memory is required.  
- **Time Complexity**: Efficiency in best, worst, and average cases.  
- **Comparison-based vs. Non-comparison-based**: Most classical algorithms are comparison-based.  

### ðŸ”„ Types of Sorting Algorithms  

1. **Bubble Sort** â†’ Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.  
2. **Selection Sort** â†’ Repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it at the correct position.  
3. **Insertion Sort** â†’ Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting into the correct position.  
4. **Merge Sort** â†’ Divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array and merges sorted halves.  
5. **Quick Sort** â†’ Divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions around a pivot.  
6. **Heap Sort** â†’ Builds a max heap and repeatedly extracts the maximum element.  
7. **Bucket Sort** â†’ Distributes elements into buckets, sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates them. Works best when input is uniformly distributed.

## ðŸ“‹ Algorithms  

### ðŸ§¾ Bubble Sort  
1. Start  
2. Input array of size `n`.  
3. Repeat for `i = 0` to `n-1`:  
   - For `j = 0` to `n-i-2`:  
     - If `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`, swap them.  
4. End  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Selection Sort  
1. Start  
2. Input array of size `n`.  
3. Repeat for `i = 0` to `n-1`:  
   - Set `minIndex = i`.  
   - For `j = i+1` to `n-1`:  
     - If `arr[j] < arr[minIndex]`, update `minIndex = j`.  
   - Swap `arr[i]` and `arr[minIndex]`.  
4. End  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Insertion Sort  
1. Start  
2. Input array of size `n`.  
3. Repeat for `i = 1` to `n-1`:  
   - Set `key = arr[i]`, `j = i-1`.  
   - While `j >= 0` and `arr[j] > key`:  
     - Shift `arr[j]` to `arr[j+1]`.  
     - Decrement `j`.  
   - Insert `key` at `arr[j+1]`.  
4. End  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Merge Sort  
1. Start  
2. If array has more than one element:  
   - Divide array into two halves.  
   - Recursively sort both halves.  
   - Merge the two sorted halves.  
3. End  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Quick Sort  
1. Start  
2. If array has more than one element:  
   - Choose a pivot element.  
   - Partition array into two subarrays:  
     - Left: elements smaller than pivot.  
     - Right: elements greater than pivot.  
   - Recursively apply quick sort on left and right subarrays.  
3. End  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Heap Sort  
1. Start  
2. Build a max heap from the array.  
3. Repeat until heap size > 1:  
   - Swap root (max element) with last element.  
   - Reduce heap size by 1.  
   - Heapify the root.  
4. End  

---

### ðŸ§¾ Bucket Sort  
1. Start  
2. Input array of size `n`.  
3. Create `k` empty buckets.  
4. Distribute elements into buckets based on a mapping function (e.g., `index = value * k`).  
5. Sort each bucket individually (using insertion sort or another algorithm).  
6. Concatenate all buckets in order to form the sorted array.  
7. End
